Changes in 201206 Version
-------------------------

1. Three new fields added in RxTerms file: SXDG_RXCUI, SXDG_TTY and SXDG_NAME. SXDG is the new RxNorm term type SCDG/SBDG (e.g. Warfarin Pill), which corresponds to the RxTerms display name: drug + intended route (e.g. Warfarin (Oral Pill)). The SXDG_RXCUI provides a standard identifier for such a combination.

2. Previously, topical medications have strengths expressed in mg/mg, mg/ml and ml/ml. These are now converted to % which is more commonly seen in prescriptions.

3. Inhalant strengths are converted to mcg/puff (instead of mg/puff).

4. More complete coverage of the duration of extended release products and transdermal patches (e.g. 8 HR XR Tab). Previously, only 12 HR XR and 24 HR XR forms are available.

2. Based on user demand, there is a new archive file (RxTermsArchive.txt) containing all drugs that appeared in previous RxTerms releases but not in the current release. Note that drugs in this file may or may not be active in RxNorm.

1. RXCUI counts by TTY (excluding suppressed and retired concepts) : SBD: 9,629; SCD: 13,756; BPCK: 361


Changes in 201112 Version
-------------------------

1. Changes in the route information which affect the ROUTE and DISPLAY_NAME fields. The rationale is to avoid the use of 'Other' and 'Oral-other', and replace them with more informative and uniform names. This will also make RxTerms routes and dose forms better aligned with the new DFG (Dose Form Groups) term type in RxNorm.

2. Strength unit 'actuat' changed to 'injection' for injectables, 'spray' for topical sprays and 'puff' for inhalants

3. Extra 'EC' removed for display names already containing this information (e.g. VIDEX EC)

4. RXCUI counts by TTY (excluding suppressed and retired concepts) : SBD: 9,655; SCD: 13,659; BPCK: 358

1. RXCUI counts by TTY (excluding suppressed and retired concepts) : SBD: 9,487; SCD: 13,460; BPCK: 360


Changes in 201106 Version
-------------------------

1. RxNorm releases a new subset called Current Prescribable Content which is an approximation of all prescribable drugs marketed in the US. RxTerms will be generated based on this subset, applying the same filtering criteria which suppress certain classes of drugs and drug names (e.g. allergenic extracts, very long drug names, generic names for multiple ingredient pain and cold medications). As a result of this change, the number of SBD and BPCK is reduced and SCD is increased:

RXCUI counts by TTY (excluding suppressed and retired concepts) : SBD: 9,494; SCD: 13,590; BPCK: 360

2. The display names now also incorporate tall man lettering recommended by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP)

3. Some RxNorm brand names of multiple ingredient drugs contain information about the relative strength of the components (e.g. PERCOCET 10/325). The numeric portion is already represented in the STRENGTH field in RxTerms. In such cases, RxTerms converts the brand names to the base brand name (e.g. PERCOCET).

4. Since retired drugs now account for almost half of the file content, from this version onwards, retired content will no longer be included. Whether there will be a separate archival file for obsolete content depends on user demand.

5. There is a new file (RxTermsIngredients.txt) that lists the ingredients and their RXCUIs for every clinical drug in RxTerms that is not suppressed or retired.

-------------------------

1. RXCUI counts by TTY (excluding suppressed and retired concepts) : SBD: 11,768; SCD: 10,821; BPCK: 394


Changes in 201104 Version
-------------------------

1. The coverage of NDC codes in RxNorm has expanded and obsolete NDC codes are more comprehensively flagged. The RxTerms algorithm has been modified to exclude drugs that are only associated with obsolete NDC codes. This results in a considerable drop in the number of active drugs in RxTerms, and a corresponding increase in retired drugs. The newly retired drugs are most likely to be drugs that are truly not available in the U.S.

2. RXCUI counts by TTY (excluding suppressed and retired concepts) : SBD: 11,750; SCD: 10,720; BPCK: 389
